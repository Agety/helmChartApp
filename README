#hlemchart - app

hlem install web /webapp - starts app in helm chart
if u are using minikube then u probably will need to port forward app service
in order to do that u need to run:
1 kubectl get svc - find right service name
2 minikube service service_name - this will give u new url

there is also kubernetes folder with properties for running app.py without helm chart


#Locust

in file locusthelm there is configuration for locust however 
its much easier to just use this command to run locust locally:
docker run -p 8089:8089 --mount type=bind,source=$pwd,target=/mnt/locust locustio/locust -f /mnt/locust/locustfile.py
