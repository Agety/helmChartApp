#Python

app.py is a web app that uses flask mostly for simplicity

in order to get reqest back with transferred farenheits to celsius just type <pageUrl>/<any number in float>
for example: localhost:8080/55.0


#hlemchart - app

hlem install web /webapp - starts app in helm chart

if u are using minikube then u probably will need to port forward app service
in order to do that u need to run:
1. kubectl get svc - find right service name
2. minikube service service_name - this will give u new url

there is also kubernetes folder with properties for running app.py in kubernetes without helm chart


#Locust

in file locusthelm there is configuration for locust 

however its much easier to just use this command to run locust locally in docker:
docker run -p 8089:8089 --mount type=bind,source=$pwd,target=/mnt/locust locustio/locust -f /mnt/locust/locustfile.py

There is also ready respository with prepared locust in helm chart

Add Chart Repository to Helm
helm repo add deliveryhero https://charts.deliveryhero.io/
Install Chart
helm install my-locust deliveryhero/locust --version 0.26.1
